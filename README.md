# Blackjack in Java
Yep, you heard it right: a~~nother~~ Blackjack game written in Java!

## Why?
Since i hadn't done anything with Java since summer vacation, i've decided to create a little personal project to get the rust off my brain. But also as an excuse to test out Git and VS Code.

## Can i contribute?
