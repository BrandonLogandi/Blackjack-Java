# Blackjack in Java
Yep, you heard it right: a~~nother~~ Blackjack game written in Java!

## Why?
Since i hadn't done anything with Java since summer vacation, i've decided to create a little personal project to get the rust off my brain. But also as an excuse to test out Git and VS Code.

## Can i contribute?

## Command Line Arguments
You can pass the following arguments when launching the game through a command line:

`--playerAmount x` Starts the game with `x` amount of players. **Default: 1**  

`--dealerStandOn x` Changes the amount of points the dealer must reach or surpass before they stop hitting to `x`. **Default: 17**  

`--forceShowDealerHand` Forces the dealer to always show their full hand, without hinding their second card.
